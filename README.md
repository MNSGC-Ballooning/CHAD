CHAD is an active anti-rotation platfrom originally designed by Andrew Kruger and his students at Wilbur Wright College in Chicago, IL. By using a magnetometer to read the rotation of a high-altitude ballooning stack, a stepper motor is controlled to counter this rotation. More information about CHAD is available at http://www.physi.cz/chad.html, which includes a list of parts, docuementation on their building and testing process, 3d print files and more code.

Additions to the original design includes an Arduino wireless shield for Xbee communications and SD logging. An Adafruit Ultimate GPS was also wired to an Arduino Mega that replaced the Arduino Uno used in the previous design. A method to reset both Arduinos has also been built into the system, as previous flights the Arduino Micro appeared to have issues.
